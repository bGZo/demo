    # Unlike the views you’ve written so far, the update function takes an argument, id. That corresponds to the <int:id> in the route. A real URL will look like /1/update. Flask will capture the 1, ensure it’s an int, and pass it as the id argument. If you don’t specify int: and instead do <id>, it will be a string. To generate a URL to the update page, url_for() needs to be passed the id so it knows what to fill in: url_for('blog.update', id=post['id']). This is also in the index.html file above.
    # 
    # The create and update views look very similar. The main difference is that the update view uses a post object and an UPDATE query instead of an INSERT. With some clever refactoring, you could use one view and template for both actions, but for the tutorial it’s clearer to keep them separate.
    # In template it was
    # This template has two forms. The first posts the edited data to the current page (/<id>/update). The other form contains only a button and specifies an action attribute that posts to the delete view instead. The button uses some JavaScript to show a confirmation dialog before submitting.
    # The pattern {{ request.form['title'] or post['title'] }} is used to choose what data appears in the form. When the form hasn’t been submitted, the original post data appears, but if invalid form data was posted you want to display that so the user can fix the error, so request.form is used instead. request is another variable that’s automatically available in templates.
