# The user is queried first and stored in a variable for later use.
# check_password_hash() hashes the submitted password in the same way as the stored hash and securely compares them. If they match, the password is valid.
# session is a dict that stores data across requests. When validation succeeds, the user’s id is stored in a new session. The data is stored in a cookie that is sent to the browser, and the browser then sends it back with subsequent requests. Flask securely signs the data so that it can’t be tampered with.
# Now that the user’s id is stored in the session, it will be available on subsequent requests. At the beginning of each request, if a user is logged in their information should be loaded and made available to other views.

If there is no user id, or if the id doesn’t exist, g.user will be None.

# This decorator returns a new view function that wraps the original view it’s applied to. The new function checks if a user is loaded and redirects to the login page otherwise. If a user is loaded the original view is called and continues normally. You’ll use this decorator when writing the blog views.
